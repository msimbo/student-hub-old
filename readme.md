### Assignments & Exercises
You must type each in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the program.

We will focus on materials that will help you solve practical problems as you will in the real world.
