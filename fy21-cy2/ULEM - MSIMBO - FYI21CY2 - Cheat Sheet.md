## Overview

When it comes down to it, programming boils down to one thing: using computers
to solve problems.

Now, that might be a personal problem, some business problem or things
in-between, it comes down to problem solving, and it helps to always have and
start with this perspective. There's something else to what programming is about
too.

Using computers. As much as we would love computers to understand English [^
Interestingly, there's a lot of work in this area though, if you're interested
in this, you might be interested in [Racket Programming
Language](https://racket-lang.org/) ], it doesn't we have to write in the
language it understands: computer code and that's where all these comes in.

While there are several variations of computer codes, in our context, we're
interested in the version relevant to the web, especially web programming and
for this, there are 3 versions of this that matter: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

If you understand these 3 languages, you're good to solve problems for yourself
or business that will be on the web.

Let's dive into the relevant bits.

## The Process

Let's dive into the relevant bits.

### Tools

-   Your Toolkit

    -   IDE: [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (via PHPStorm)

    -   **Text Editor**: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or

            Database Modeling, Lean/Agile Iteration

    -   **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, Vercel, Heroku

### The Languages

#### HTML

#### CSS

#### JavaScript (JS)

Now this is the "real" programming part of the stack. Like most programming
languages, the best way to get to grasp with the complexity of this language to focus on the 20% of the language used to solve 80% of the problems [^ Also
known as the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)]

Not just focusing on the 20% for the sake of it, but approaching it from the
perspective of solving problems; pragmatic problems; for you or a business.
Thankfully, there's an endless supply of those.

Let's pick a problem to help us explore some of the big ideas in JavaScript.

**A Problem:** Someone asked you to display the list of random words on a webpage that they can sort acsending and descending.

**A Solution:** [Here's the working version to play
with](https://codesandbox.io/s/w10-13-summary-9wz16?file=/src/index.js)

With this solution handy, here comes...
